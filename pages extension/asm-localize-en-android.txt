Our hospital, which works in strategic cooperation with Johns Hopkins Medicine for the improvement of education and quality; offers services in all branches, especially oncological sciences, heart health, women's health and IVF, neurological sciences, surgical sciences, internal sciences, diagnosis and imaging. Our hospital, which was established on a land area of ​​approximately 188,000 square meters and continues to work with a 201 bed capacity in a closed area of ​​50 thousand square meters, provides services with JCI (Joint Commission International) accreditation and ESMO (European Medical Oncology Association) certifications.
